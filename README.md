This project was completed from Frontend Mentor challenges as a level 3 challenge.

I have used CSS, HTML and JavaScript to make the app work. 

The app is an IP tracking application that uses the implementation of two APIs (Leaflet.js and IPify) which once typed in a location or IP address updates the map and information accordingly.

You can check the live demo: https://norvalbv.github.io/IP-Address-Tracker/
